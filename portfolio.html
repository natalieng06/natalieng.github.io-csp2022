    <h1 style="color:#734835; text-align:center;">  My project is called the “Minion Creator”. The main objective as in the name is to create a minion based off of the user’s inputs. The code allows the user to have 18 different variations of a minion such as a small minion with one eye and red overalls all the way to a large minion with two eyes and blue overalls. Once the user finishes customizing their minion, the minion gets on top of Gru’s car and rides away off the screen. Then, the user is greeted by their minion with a background saying TA-DA!.</h1>

    <h1 style="color:#734835; text-align:center;">  My project is called the “Fishing Game”. The goal of this game is to click as many fish as possible during the 15 seconds timer. Each fish will be worth different points and they will appear randomly on the screen. The game will update the player's score on the screen. After the game is over, a leaderboard will show up to show the player their rank.</h1>

    <h1 style="color:#734835; text-align:center;"> My ecard was designed for the kids in the children's hospitals. This greeting card is interactive and the kids will be able to figure out what type of puppy they are by picking the image that they like more. This card is colorful, fun, and cute, which could be a nice distraction that can bring a smile to their faces.</h1>
